## General info
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. To better serve customers the start-up wants to better understand how users interact with the app and there's no better way to do it at scale than applying dimensional modelling best practises in a data warehouse.
